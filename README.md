CSS visual design topics

## 1-text-align :

- `text-align: justify;` causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.
- `text-align: center;` centers the text

- `text-align: right;` right-aligns the text

- `text-align: left;` (the default) left-aligns the text.

## 2 - width :

```css
img {
  width: 220px;
}
```

- You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

## 3 - height :

```css
img {
  height: 20px;
}
```

You can specify the height of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the width property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:

## 4 - font-weight: bold :

To make text bold, you can use the strong tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.

## 5 - font-decoration:underline :

To underline text, you can use the u tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.

## 6 - font-style italic :

To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.

## 7 - text-decoration: line-through :

To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.
